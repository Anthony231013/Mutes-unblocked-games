      <p>
        You don’t need to be “good at art” to draw a person. You just need
        simple shapes, patience, and practice.tap here for a drawing website

        <h3>1. Start with a stick figure</h3>
        <p>
          Lightly sketch a stick figure to capture the pose: a circle for the
          head, a line for the spine, and lines for arms and legs.
        </p>

      <article class="step">
        <h3>2. Add simple 3D forms</h3>
        <p>
          Turn the stick figure into basic volumes: cylinders for arms and legs,
          a box or oval for the ribcage, and a smaller shape for the pelvis.
        </p>

      <article class="step">
        <h3>3. Block in the head and face</h3>
        <p>
          Draw an oval for the head. Add a vertical line down the middle and a
          horizontal line halfway for the eyes. Place the nose halfway between
          eyes and chin, and the mouth halfway between nose and chin.
        </p>

      <article class="step">
        <h3>4. Refine the body outline</h3>
        <p>
          Use the simple forms as a guide and draw the outer contour of the
          body—neck, shoulders, torso, hips, arms, and legs. Keep your lines
          light so you can adjust.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="step">
        <h3>5. Add hands and feet</h3>
        <p>
          Start with simple shapes: a mitten shape for the hand and a wedge for
          the foot. Don’t worry about details yet—focus on proportion and
          direction.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="step">
        <h3>6. Add clothing and details</h3>
        <p>
          Draw clothing over the body, following the underlying forms. Add hair,
          facial features, and any accessories that fit the character.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="step">
        <h3>7. Clean up and shade</h3>
        <p>
          Erase construction lines you no longer need. Darken your final lines
          and add simple shading to show light and shadow.

      <h2>Practice tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gesture drawing:</strong> Do 1–2 minute sketches to capture poses quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Study references:</strong> Use photos or pose websites to learn real proportions.</li>
        <li><strong>Break it down:</strong> Practice heads, hands, and poses separately.</li>
        <li><strong>Draw daily:</strong> Even 10 minutes a day builds skill over time.</li>
      </ul>
